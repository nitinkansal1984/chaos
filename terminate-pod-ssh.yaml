title: What happens if we terminate a Pod?
description: If a Pod is terminated, a new one should be created in its places.

steady-state-hypothesis:       ## with below SSH, we are ensuring number of pods running is 1 before action and after action. Basically validate the pod that it exist, terminate with action, then validate.

  probes:
  - name: pod-exists
    type: probe                      ## Probe the pod state before and after the action
    tolerance: 1                     ## Expect to have exactly one POD in specified namespace
